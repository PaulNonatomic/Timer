## Coding Guidelines

The Timers package follows the [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions). Please ensure your code contributions adhere to these standards.

## Local Development

As this project is a Unity Package I find the best way to develop it is to create a new Unity project and add the package as a local package. This allows you to test the package in a real Unity environment.
My personal preference is to clone the repo and simlink the package into the Unity project's Packages folder. This allows me to easily make changes to the package and test them in the Unity project.
